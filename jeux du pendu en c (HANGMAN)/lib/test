Congratulations, you succeeded in decrypting this message
The real subject is to write a program to encrypt a file or
string and write the result in a file named 'crypt'.
To encrypt a file we will use the '-f' parameter, for a string we will use '-s'.
Since it is a crypted file, nobody should be able to modify its contents,
that's why your program should set the read-only rights to the 'crypt' file.
Usage: ./cesar -f filename key OR ./cesar -s "string" key
